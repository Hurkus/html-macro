<div id="ATTR-INCLUDE" class="macro box" IF='!header'>
	<h4><a href="#ATTR-INCLUDE" class="code">INCLUDE=...</a></h4>
	<p>Include contents of another file as child elements of the current element.</p>
	<x-line></x-line>
	
	<style>
		#ATTR-INCLUDE.macro ul.file-types li {
			padding-top: 5px;
		}
	</style>
	<p>
		Must be in the form of <code>{l}... INCLUDE="[name]" ...{r}</code> or <code>{l}... INCLUDE-[type]="[name]" ...{r}</code>, where:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>[path]</code> represents the path of the new file relative to the current file.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>[type]</code> represents the forced interpretation of the file being included.
				Optional only when the type of the file can be determined from the path extension.
				<br/>
				Valid types are:
				<ul class="file-types">
					<li id="INCLUDE-HTML">
						<code>HTML</code> for <em>.html</em> files.<br/>
						The file is parsed as an HTML macro, i.e. the root element is invoked as a macro after parsing.<br/>
						All <a CALL="link-em-MACRO">{l}MACRO{r}</a> elements are added to the global list of defined macros (overwriting existing ones).
					</li>
					<li id="INCLUDE-CSS">
						<code>CSS</code> for style <em>.css</em> files.<br/>
						The file is processed for any CSS expressions.<br/>
						May be subjected to optimizations in future versions.
					</li>
					<li id="INCLUDE-JS">
						<code>JS</code> for JavaScript <em>.js</em> files.<br/>
						Mainly untouched; handled as plain text.<br/>
						May be subjected to optimizations in future versions.
					</li>
					<li id="INCLUDE-TXT">
						<code>TXT</code> for plain text files.<br/>
						Untouched; coppied to the final document.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	
	<br/>
	<p>
		The file is included immediately after encountering the attribute.
		This means that some attributes might not have fully coppied to the final document.
		This would affect macros such as <a CALL="link-em-DEL-ATTR">{l}DEL-ATTR{r}</a>, as they would not be able to remove attributes that do not exist yet.
		If such behaviour is unwanted, the attribute macro should be written after all others.
		<br/><br/>
		After including the file, all child elements are evaluated/appended to the final document as per the standard procedure.
		This attribute macro is esentially an attribute version of the <a CALL="link-em-INCLUDE">{l}INCLUDE{r}</a> macro.
